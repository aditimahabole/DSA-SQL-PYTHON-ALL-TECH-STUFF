Sure, here's an explanation of each line in the code snippet you provided:

rust
Copy code
use solana_program::{program_error::ProgramError};
use thiserror::Error;
These are Rust import statements, used to bring external crates and modules into scope for the current file. The first line imports the ProgramError type from the solana_program crate, while the second line imports the Error trait from the thiserror crate.

rust
Copy code
#[derive(Error)]
pub enum NoteError {
  #[error("Wrong note owner")]
  Forbidden,

  #[error("Text is too long")]
  InvalidLength
}
This is a Rust enum definition, which declares a custom data type called NoteError. The #[derive(Error)] attribute indicates that the NoteError type will implement the Error trait from the thiserror crate.

The enum has two variants: Forbidden, which represents an error where the note owner is incorrect, and InvalidLength, which represents an error where the text of the note is too long. The #[error("...")] attribute on each variant specifies a string literal that will be used as the error message when the variant is converted to an Error object.

Overall, this code defines a custom error type called NoteError with two variants, and uses the thiserror crate to automatically implement the Error trait for this type. This allows the NoteError type to be used as an error return type in Rust functions and methods, with the appropriate error message being generated when necessary.
